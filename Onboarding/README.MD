# New member orientation and checklist

## Introduction

We, the flight control team, have created an onboarding checklist to assist a newcomer through the days, weeks, and months as a new member. This document serves as a list of tasks for you to complete with corresponding timelines. Some items listed below are transactional (for example: completing a form) while others involve having conversations or taking classes to learn more about how Nakuja flight control works.
